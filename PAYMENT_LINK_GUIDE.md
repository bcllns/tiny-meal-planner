3. Click "user_profiles" table
4. Find your test user (by email)
5. Click to edit the row
6. Update these fields:
   ```
   subscription_status: active
   subscription_end_date: 2026-10-12 (1 year from now)
   ```
7. Save

#### Test Unlimited Access

- Go back to your app
- Click "Plan Meals" again
- It should work! ‚úÖ (No payment modal)
- You now have unlimited meal planning

## Production Setup

When you're ready to go live:

### 1. Create Live Payment Link

Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links (no /test)

Create a new Payment Link with:

- Same settings as test
- Success URL: `https://yourdomain.com/dashboard?payment=success`

### 2. Update Code

```typescript
// src/lib/stripe.ts

// Change from test link:
export const STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK = "https://buy.stripe.com/test_XXXXXX";

// To live link:
export const STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK = "https://buy.stripe.com/live_XXXXXX";
```

### 3. Set Up Webhook (Recommended)

See `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SETUP.md` for automatic database updates.

## Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå "Cannot find STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK"

**Problem:** The constant is not exported

**Solution:**

1. Check `src/lib/stripe.ts` line 13
2. Make sure it's exported: `export const STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK = '...'`
3. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

### ‚ùå Clicking "Subscribe Now" does nothing

**Problem:** Payment Link URL is not set or incorrect

**Solution:**

1. Check the URL in `src/lib/stripe.ts`
2. Should look like: `https://buy.stripe.com/test_...`
3. Test the URL by pasting in browser - should open Stripe checkout

### ‚ùå Payment succeeds but still shows payment modal

**Problem:** Database not updated with subscription

**Solution:**

1. Go to Supabase ‚Üí user_profiles table
2. Find your user
3. Update `subscription_status` to `active`
4. Or set up webhook (see `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SETUP.md`)

### ‚ùå "Payment not found" after redirect

**Problem:** Success URL doesn't match

**Solution:**

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Payment Links
2. Click your Payment Link
3. Check "After payment" success URL
4. Should be: `http://localhost:5174/dashboard?payment=success`

## What Each Part Does

### Payment Link (Stripe-hosted)

```
https://buy.stripe.com/test_XXXXXX
```

- Hosted by Stripe (not your server)
- Handles all payment details
- PCI compliant automatically
- Mobile responsive
- Secure and trusted

### URL Parameters

```
?prefilled_email=user@example.com&client_reference_id=user_abc123
```

- `prefilled_email`: Auto-fills user's email
- `client_reference_id`: Tracks which user paid (for webhook)

### Success URL

```
http://localhost:5174/dashboard?payment=success
```

- Where Stripe redirects after payment
- `?payment=success` helps you show confirmation message
