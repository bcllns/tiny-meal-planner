# âœ… User Profile Auto-Creation with Database Trigger

## Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

You've successfully set up **automatic user profile creation** using a PostgreSQL trigger. This is the most robust approach!

## How It Works

### The Flow

```
1. User signs up in your app
   â†“
2. Supabase creates auth.users record
   â†“
3. ðŸ”¥ Database trigger fires automatically
   â†“
4. user_profiles record created with:
   - user_id (from auth)
   - email (from auth)
   - full_name (from metadata)
   - trial_used = false âœ…
   - All subscription fields = null
   â†“
5. User can immediately use the app with free trial!
```

### What Was Set Up

**Database (Supabase):**

- âœ… `user_profiles` table created
- âœ… Database trigger: `on_auth_user_created`
- âœ… Trigger function: `handle_new_user()`
- âœ… RLS policies configured
- âœ… Automatic profile creation enabled

**App Code:**

- âœ… `signUp()` function simplified
- âœ… Removed manual profile creation
- âœ… Trigger handles everything automatically

## Benefits of This Approach

### âœ… Advantages

1. **Fully Automatic** - No app code needed
2. **100% Reliable** - Trigger always fires when user created
3. **Bypasses RLS** - Uses SECURITY DEFINER (elevated privileges)
4. **Simpler Code** - App doesn't need to manage profile creation
5. **Guaranteed Consistency** - Every user gets a profile automatically
6. **Error-Proof** - Even if app code fails, profile is created

### ðŸŽ¯ What This Means

- Every new user automatically gets a profile
- `trial_used` is always set to `false`
- No manual intervention needed
- No RLS policy issues
- Works even if your app has bugs!

## Testing

### Test 1: Sign Up

```javascript
// In your app
1. Go to sign up page
2. Enter:
   - Email: test-trigger@example.com
   - Password: TestPassword123!
   - Name: Test User
3. Click Sign Up
4. âœ… User created
```

### Test 2: Verify Profile Creation

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT user_id, email, full_name, trial_used, created_at
FROM user_profiles
WHERE email = 'test-trigger@example.com';

-- Expected result:
-- user_id: [UUID]
-- email: test-trigger@example.com
-- full_name: Test User
-- trial_used: false âœ…
-- created_at: [timestamp]
```

### Test 3: Verify Trial Works

```javascript
// In your app
1. Log in with test-trigger@example.com
2. Click "Plan Meals"
3. Fill out form
4. âœ… Should work (trial available)
5. Try "Plan Meals" again
6. âœ… Payment modal appears (trial used)
```

## How the Trigger Works

### The Trigger Function

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Automatically insert profile when user created
  INSERT INTO public.user_profiles (user_id, email, full_name, trial_used)
  VALUES (
    NEW.id,                    -- User ID from auth.users
    NEW.email,                 -- Email from auth.users
    COALESCE(                  -- Full name from metadata or email
      NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name',
      split_part(NEW.email, '@', 1)
    ),
    false                      -- Trial not used yet
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

### What It Does

1. Fires AFTER user inserted into `auth.users`
2. Extracts user data (id, email, metadata)
3. Inserts into `user_profiles` with `trial_used = false`
4. Returns to complete the signup process

### SECURITY DEFINER

- Runs with elevated privileges
- Bypasses Row Level Security
- Guaranteed to work every time

## Monitoring

### Check if Trigger Exists

```sql
SELECT trigger_name, event_manipulation, event_object_table, action_statement
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE trigger_name = 'on_auth_user_created';
```

Should return:

- `trigger_name`: on_auth_user_created
- `event_manipulation`: INSERT
- `event_object_table`: users

### Check if Function Exists

```sql
SELECT proname, prosrc
FROM pg_proc
WHERE proname = 'handle_new_user';
```

Should return the function definition.

### View Recent Profile Creations

```sql
SELECT user_id, email, full_name, trial_used, created_at
FROM user_profiles
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Profile Not Created After Signup

**Check 1: Trigger Exists**

```sql
SELECT * FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE trigger_name = 'on_auth_user_created';
```

If empty, re-run: `database/create_user_profiles_with_trigger.sql`

**Check 2: Function Exists**

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'handle_new_user';
```

If empty, re-run the SQL migration.

**Check 3: Auth User Created**

```sql
SELECT id, email, created_at
FROM auth.users
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

If user exists but no profile, manually trigger:

```sql
-- Get the user ID
SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';

-- Manually create profile
INSERT INTO user_profiles (user_id, email, full_name, trial_used)
SELECT id, email,
       COALESCE(raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', split_part(email, '@', 1)),
       false
FROM auth.users
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### Trigger Fires But Error Occurs

**Check Supabase Logs:**

1. Supabase Dashboard â†’ Logs â†’ Database
2. Look for errors related to `handle_new_user`
3. Common issues:
   - Column doesn't exist â†’ Re-run table creation
   - RLS policy issue â†’ The trigger should bypass this
   - Constraint violation â†’ Check unique constraint on user_id

### Multiple Profiles Created

**Check for duplicate trigger:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE trigger_name LIKE '%auth_user_created%';
```

Should be 1. If more, drop extras:

```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS duplicate_trigger_name ON auth.users;
```

## App Code Changes

### Before (Manual Creation)

```typescript
// Old code - 40+ lines
if (data.user) {
  const { error: profileError } = await supabase
    .from('user_profiles')
    .insert({...})
  // Error handling...
}
```

### After (Automatic Trigger)

```typescript
// New code - 2 lines
console.log("User signed up successfully:", data.user?.email);
console.log("Profile created automatically by database trigger");
```

**Lines of code reduced:** 40+ â†’ 2 âœ…

## Maintenance

### Update Trigger (If Needed)

If you need to change what data is inserted:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.user_profiles (user_id, email, full_name, trial_used, NEW_FIELD)
  VALUES (
    NEW.id,
    NEW.email,
    COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', split_part(NEW.email, '@', 1)),
    false,
    'new_value'  -- Add new fields here
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

### Disable Trigger (Emergency)

```sql
ALTER TABLE auth.users DISABLE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created;
```

### Re-enable Trigger

```sql
ALTER TABLE auth.users ENABLE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created;
```

### Delete Trigger

```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_auth_user_created ON auth.users;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.handle_new_user();
```
