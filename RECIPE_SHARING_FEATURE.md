# Recipe Sharing Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Added a complete recipe sharing feature that allows users to generate shareable links for any recipe. Non-logged-in users can view shared recipes via a public URL.

## Files Created

### 1. Database Schema

**File:** `database/create_shared_recipes_table.sql`

- **Table:** `shared_recipes` with fields for recipe data, share tracking, and metadata
- **Indexes:** On share_id, user_id, recipe_id, and created_at for performance
- **RLS Policies:**
  - Public SELECT (anyone can view shared recipes)
  - Authenticated INSERT (users can create shares)
  - User-specific UPDATE/DELETE (users manage own shares)
- **Functions:**
  - `generate_share_id()`: Generates unique 8-character alphanumeric IDs
  - `increment_share_view_count()`: Tracks view counts for analytics
- **Trigger:** Auto-update updated_at timestamp

### 2. Share Helper Library

**File:** `src/lib/shareRecipe.ts`

- **Functions:**
  - `shareRecipe(recipe, userName)`: Creates shareable link, returns URL with ?share=ID format
  - `getSharedRecipe(shareId)`: Fetches recipe, increments view count
  - `getUserSharedRecipes()`: Lists all shares by current user
  - `deleteSharedRecipe(shareId)`: Removes shared recipe
- **Types:** SharedRecipe interface matching database schema

### 3. Share Dialog Component

**File:** `src/components/ShareDialog.tsx`

- Copy-to-clipboard functionality with visual feedback
- Loading state during share URL generation
- Success message with usage instructions
- Error handling for failed share operations
- Accessible via both MealCard and MyRecipesView

### 4. Public Recipe View

**File:** `src/components/SharedRecipeView.tsx`

- Full-screen overlay component for viewing shared recipes
- Displays recipe details: ingredients, instructions, servings, timing
- Shows "Shared by [name]" attribution
- Close button to return to main app
- Error state for invalid/missing recipes
- Loading state during recipe fetch
- Converts SharedRecipe DB format to Meal type for display

## Files Modified

### 1. MealCard Component

**File:** `src/components/MealCard.tsx`
**Changes:**

- Added Share button to popover menu (between Save and Print)
- Integrated ShareDialog for URL generation and copying
- Fetches user name from Supabase auth for attribution
- State management for share dialog visibility and URL

### 2. MyRecipesView Component

**File:** `src/components/MyRecipesView.tsx`
**Changes:**

- Added Share button to recipe popover menu
- Same ShareDialog integration as MealCard
- Handles sharing for saved recipes (supports both Meal and SavedRecipe types)
- User attribution via Supabase auth

### 3. App Component

**File:** `src/App.tsx`
**Changes:**

- Added SharedRecipeView import and state
- URL parameter detection for `?share=ID` links
- Renders SharedRecipeView overlay when share link is detected
- Auto-cleans URL after capturing share ID
- Shared recipe view accessible to non-authenticated users

## How It Works

### Sharing Flow (Authenticated Users)

1. User clicks "Share" button on any recipe card (dashboard or My Recipes)
2. ShareDialog opens with loading state
3. System:
   - Fetches user's name from Supabase auth
   - Calls `shareRecipe()` which:
     - Generates unique 8-char share_id via DB function
     - Inserts recipe data to shared_recipes table
     - Returns URL: `https://yourapp.com?share=ABC12345`
4. ShareDialog displays URL with copy button
5. User copies link and shares with others

### Viewing Flow (Anyone, Including Non-Authenticated)

1. Someone visits `https://yourapp.com?share=ABC12345`
2. App.tsx detects `?share=` parameter
3. Renders SharedRecipeView overlay with share_id
4. Component calls `getSharedRecipe()`:
   - Fetches recipe from database
   - Increments view_count for analytics
   - Returns recipe data with sharedBy name
5. Displays full recipe in read-only format
6. User can close to return to main app

## Database Migration Required

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```bash
# Copy contents of database/create_shared_recipes_table.sql
# Paste into Supabase SQL Editor and execute
```

The migration creates:

- `shared_recipes` table with proper constraints
- 4 indexes for query performance
- RLS policies for public read, authenticated write
- Helper functions for ID generation and view tracking
- Trigger for timestamp updates

## Features

### Security

- ✅ RLS policies ensure users only modify their own shares
- ✅ Public read access for shared recipes (intended behavior)
- ✅ share_id collision detection in generate_share_id()
- ✅ User attribution stored with shared_by_name

### Analytics

- ✅ view_count tracking for each share
- ✅ created_at/updated_at timestamps
- ✅ User-specific share history via getUserSharedRecipes()

### User Experience

- ✅ One-click copy to clipboard
- ✅ Visual feedback (Copied! message)
- ✅ Loading states during generation
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Clean URLs (removes ?share= after loading)
- ✅ Works for non-authenticated users (public access)

### Data Integrity

- ✅ Optional recipe_id reference (can share both saved and AI-generated)
- ✅ Stores complete recipe data (ingredients, instructions, etc.)
- ✅ Handles both Meal and SavedRecipe types
- ✅ Converts between SharedRecipe and Meal formats

## URL Format

- **Share Link:** `https://yourapp.com?share=ABC12345`
- **8-character alphanumeric ID:** Collision-free via DB function
- **Query parameter approach:** Works with SPA (no routing required)

## Testing Checklist

1. **Share Creation**

   - [ ] Click Share on dashboard meal card → dialog opens with URL
   - [ ] Click Share on My Recipes → dialog opens with URL
   - [ ] Copy button copies URL to clipboard
   - [ ] "Copied!" feedback appears for 2 seconds

2. **Share Viewing**

   - [ ] Visit share URL → recipe displays correctly
   - [ ] Non-logged-in users can view shared recipes
   - [ ] "Shared by [name]" displays correct attribution
   - [ ] Close button returns to main app
   - [ ] Invalid share_id shows "Recipe Not Found" error

3. **Database**
   - [ ] Run migration SQL successfully
   - [ ] Check shared_recipes table exists
   - [ ] Verify RLS policies allow public SELECT
   - [ ] Test view_count increments on each view
