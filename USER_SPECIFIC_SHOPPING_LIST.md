# User-Specific Shopping List Implementation

## Overview

The shopping list has been updated to be user-specific, ensuring that each user only sees their own shopping list items. When a user logs out, their shopping list is cleared from localStorage, and when a new user logs in, they will not see the previous user's shopping list.

## Problem Solved

**Before:** The shopping list was stored in a shared localStorage key (`meal_planner_shopping_list`), which meant:

- All users on the same browser shared the same shopping list
- When User A logged out and User B logged in, User B could see User A's shopping list
- Privacy concern - users could see each other's data

**After:** Each user has their own isolated shopping list:

- Shopping lists are stored with user-specific keys (`meal_planner_shopping_list_<userId>`)
- Users can only access their own shopping lists
- Shopping lists are automatically cleared on logout
- Complete user data isolation

## Implementation Changes

### 1. Shopping List Library (`src/lib/shoppingList.ts`)

#### Added User-Specific Storage Keys

```typescript
const STORAGE_KEY_PREFIX = "meal_planner_shopping_list";
const CONSOLIDATED_CACHE_KEY_PREFIX = "meal_planner_consolidated_list";

function getStorageKey(userId: string | null): string {
  return userId ? `${STORAGE_KEY_PREFIX}_${userId}` : STORAGE_KEY_PREFIX;
}

function getConsolidatedCacheKey(userId: string | null): string {
  return userId ? `${CONSOLIDATED_CACHE_KEY_PREFIX}_${userId}` : CONSOLIDATED_CACHE_KEY_PREFIX;
}
```

#### Updated All Functions to Accept userId

All shopping list functions now accept an optional `userId` parameter:

- `getShoppingList(userId: string | null = null)`
- `addToShoppingList(recipe: SavedRecipe, userId: string | null = null)`
- `removeFromShoppingList(recipeId: string, userId: string | null = null)`
- `clearShoppingList(userId: string | null = null)`
- `isInShoppingList(recipeId: string, userId: string | null = null)`
- `getCachedConsolidatedList(userId: string | null = null)`
- `setCachedConsolidatedList(recipeIds, consolidated, userId: string | null = null)`
- `hasShoppingListChanged(userId: string | null = null)`

### 2. ShoppingListView Component (`src/components/ShoppingListView.tsx`)

#### Added userId Prop

```typescript
interface ShoppingListViewProps {
  userId?: string | null;
}

export function ShoppingListView({ userId = null }: ShoppingListViewProps);
```

#### Updated All Function Calls

All shopping list function calls now pass the userId:

```typescript
const list = getShoppingList(userId);
const needsConsolidation = hasShoppingListChanged(userId);
const cache = getCachedConsolidatedList(userId);
setCachedConsolidatedList(recipeIds, consolidated, userId);
clearShoppingList(userId);
```

#### Added userId to useEffect Dependency

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  loadShoppingList();
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
}, [userId]);
```

This ensures the shopping list reloads when the user changes.

### 3. MyRecipesView Component (`src/components/MyRecipesView.tsx`)

#### Added userId Prop

```typescript
interface MyRecipesViewProps {
  userId?: string | null;
}

export function MyRecipesView({ userId = null }: MyRecipesViewProps);
```

#### Updated Shopping List Function Calls

```typescript
// Check if in shopping list
if (isInShoppingList(recipe.meal_id, userId))
  // Add to shopping list
  addToShoppingList(recipe, userId);

// Remove from shopping list
removeFromShoppingList(mealId, userId);
```

### 4. App Component (`src/App.tsx`)

#### Import clearShoppingList

```typescript
import { clearShoppingList } from "@/lib/shoppingList";
```

#### Clear Shopping List on Logout

```typescript
const handleSignOut = async () => {
  // Clear user-specific shopping list before signing out
  if (user?.id) {
    clearShoppingList(user.id);
  }

  await signOut();
  // ... rest of logout logic
};
```

#### Pass userId to Components

```typescript
{
  activeTab === "recipes" && <MyRecipesView userId={user?.id} />;
}

{
  activeTab === "shopping" && <ShoppingListView userId={user?.id} />;
}
```

## How It Works

### Storage Key Pattern

```
Without userId (backward compatible):
- meal_planner_shopping_list
- meal_planner_consolidated_list

With userId (user-specific):
- meal_planner_shopping_list_abc123
- meal_planner_consolidated_list_abc123
```

### User Flow

#### Login Scenario

```
User A logs in (userId: "user-a-123")
    â†“
Shopping list uses key: "meal_planner_shopping_list_user-a-123"
    â†“
User A adds recipes to shopping list
    â†“
Data saved to localStorage with user-specific key
    â†“
User A logs out
    â†“
Shopping list cleared: "meal_planner_shopping_list_user-a-123" removed
```

#### User Switch Scenario

```
User A logged in, has shopping list with 5 items
    â†“
User A logs out â†’ Shopping list cleared
    â†“
User B logs in (userId: "user-b-456")
    â†“
Shopping list uses key: "meal_planner_shopping_list_user-b-456"
    â†“
User B sees EMPTY shopping list (correct!)
    â†“
User B's data completely isolated from User A
```

## Security & Privacy

### Data Isolation

âœ… Each user has completely separate shopping list data
âœ… Users cannot access other users' shopping lists
âœ… Shopping lists are automatically cleared on logout
âœ… No data leakage between user sessions

### localStorage Keys

âœ… User-specific keys prevent cross-contamination
âœ… Keys include user ID for complete isolation
âœ… Backward compatible with null userId (for edge cases)

### Logout Behavior

âœ… Explicitly clears user's shopping list
âœ… Removes consolidated cache
âœ… Clean slate for next user

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains backward compatibility:

1. **userId is optional** - All functions have `userId: string | null = null`
2. **Null userId fallback** - Uses original key names when userId is null
3. **Existing data** - Old shopping lists without userId still work (though not isolated)

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Single User

```
1. User logs in
2. Adds recipes to shopping list
3. Logs out
4. Logs back in
Expected: Shopping list is empty (cleared on logout)
```

### Test Case 2: Multiple Users

```
1. User A logs in
2. User A adds 3 recipes to shopping list
3. User A logs out
4. User B logs in
5. User B checks shopping list
Expected: User B sees empty shopping list (not User A's items)
```

### Test Case 3: User Data Isolation

```
1. User A logs in and adds recipes
2. User A logs out
3. User B logs in and adds different recipes
4. User B logs out
5. User A logs back in
Expected: User A sees empty shopping list (cleared on previous logout)
```

### Test Case 4: Consolidated Cache

```
1. User logs in
2. Adds recipes and consolidates shopping list
3. Consolidated cache saved with user-specific key
4. User logs out
5. Cache cleared along with shopping list
```

## Benefits

### For Users

âœ… **Privacy** - Shopping lists are completely private
âœ… **Security** - No data leakage between users
âœ… **Clean Experience** - No confusion from seeing other users' items
âœ… **Fresh Start** - Each login starts with clean state

### For Developers

âœ… **User Isolation** - Proper data separation
âœ… **Maintainable** - Clear, predictable behavior
âœ… **Scalable** - Works with any number of users
âœ… **Debuggable** - Easy to identify user-specific issues

### For Privacy

âœ… **No Cross-User Data** - Complete isolation
âœ… **Automatic Cleanup** - Data removed on logout
âœ… **Compliant** - Better privacy practices
âœ… **Transparent** - Clear data ownership

## localStorage Structure

### Before (Shared)

```
localStorage:
  meal_planner_shopping_list: [recipe1, recipe2, recipe3]
  meal_planner_consolidated_list: {...}
```

### After (User-Specific)

```
localStorage:
  meal_planner_shopping_list_user-a-123: [recipeA1, recipeA2]
  meal_planner_consolidated_list_user-a-123: {...}
  meal_planner_shopping_list_user-b-456: [recipeB1, recipeB2, recipeB3]
  meal_planner_consolidated_list_user-b-456: {...}
```

On logout:

```
User A logs out:
  âœ… meal_planner_shopping_list_user-a-123 â†’ REMOVED
  âœ… meal_planner_consolidated_list_user-a-123 â†’ REMOVED

User B's data remains:
  âœ“ meal_planner_shopping_list_user-b-456: [recipeB1, recipeB2, recipeB3]
  âœ“ meal_planner_consolidated_list_user-b-456: {...}
```

## Edge Cases Handled

### No User ID

- Functions fall back to original key names
- Backward compatible behavior
- Works for anonymous/unauthenticated scenarios

### User Switches Without Logout

- Each user still gets their own data
- Keys are different by design
- No cross-contamination possible

### Browser Shared by Multiple Users

- Each user has completely separate shopping lists
- No privacy concerns
- Proper data isolation

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- **Persistent Storage**: Save shopping lists to Supabase for cross-device access
- **Offline Sync**: Sync localStorage with database when online
- **Shopping List History**: Track past shopping lists per user
- **Share Feature**: Allow users to share specific shopping lists
- **Export**: Download shopping list as PDF with user attribution

## Migration Notes

No migration required! The changes are:

- Backward compatible
- Non-breaking
- Automatically applied on next user interaction

Existing shopping lists without userId will continue to work but won't be user-isolated until the user logs in/out again.

## Summary

The shopping list is now **completely user-specific and secure**:

âœ… Each user has their own isolated shopping list
âœ… Shopping lists are cleared on logout  
âœ… No data leakage between users
âœ… Proper privacy and security implemented
âœ… Clean user experience
âœ… Backward compatible

Users can now confidently use the shopping list feature knowing their data is private and will not be visible to other users! ðŸ”’
